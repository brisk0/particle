Particle
========
Particle demo / test / library.

Nothing about this is particularly plug and play, and never will be (but will be a library eventually). Look to the code for implementation ideas / an example.

To run, get the repo and run:

	make release
	./particle

In the repo's root directory. Enjoy some pretty imagery.
